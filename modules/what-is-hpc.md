What is a supercomputer and why do we care?
-------------------------------------------
*Learning Objectives*
*    Student will understand that a supercomputer is made up of many personal computers, called nodes, that work together over a high speed network.
*    Student will be able to demonstrate an understanding of what kind of problems would be helped by a supercomputer and what kind of problems would not be helped by a supercomputer.
*    Students will be able to define the terms `parallel` and `serial`, and their implications for supercomputing.

What is a Supercomputer?
------------------------
Supercomputing has a long rich history in academic research. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TRfy70DqD8 "Ferranti Atlas: Britain's first supercomputer") to see a video of what supercomputing looked like at its inception. A common misconception of supercomputing is that supercomputers are giant, futuristic machines computing massive calculations that cannot be done on a personal computer. While supercomputers do allow their users to push beyond the capabilities of a personal computer, they are not actually a single machine. In fact, supercomputers are simply many “normal” computers that have been connected by a high speed network that allows them to work together on a problem that would be too big for any single computer to take on by itself. Most supercomputers simply look like the server racks that are found in a data center. One supercomputer can have anywhere from two (not very useful) to hundreds of single computers networked together. Each of the single computers are referred to as nodes.
