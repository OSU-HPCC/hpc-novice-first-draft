Some Thoughts:
--------------
*    Given that most of our users are running pre-installed software, I don't think it's useful to talk about programming or hardware performance. Also, architecture discussions should be kept to a minimum - just enough so that the users understand a cluster is a bunch of computers networked together.
*    Shell stuff should be referred to the bash SWC lesson
*    Are we trying to work on the swc repo (hpc-novice) or the data carpentry repo (hpc-carpentry)?
