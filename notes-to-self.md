Possible Modules (not necessarily in this order):
-----------------
*    Getting files on and off the cluster
*    Working with a scheduler and submitting jobs
*    Submit scripts
*    What is a supercomputer/why learn (basic ideas behind supercomputing and how it is done)?
*    Best practices (backing up files, organizing output files, etc.)
*    Modules
*    Logging in


Learning Objectives:

Some Thoughts:
--------------
*    Given that most of our users are running pre-installed software, I don't think it's useful to talk about programming or hardware performance. Also, architecture discussions should be kept to a minimum - just enough so that the users understand a cluster is a bunch of computers networked together.
*    Shell stuff should be referred to the bash SWC lesson
*    Are we trying to work on the swc repo (hpc-novice) or the data carpentry repo (hpc-carpentry)?
